			<h4>1.Collect Some Shellfishes</h4>
			<br>
			<p> Murex brandaris and Thais haemastoma, native to the Mediterranean, are specieses of medium-sized predatory sea snail, an edible marine gastropod mollusk in the family Muricidae, the murex snails or the rock snails. To make the dye, we need both of these shells.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>2.Break the Shell</h4>
			<br>
			<p> Use a hammer to crack open the shell of one of these spiky, carnivorous gastropods, you will see a pale hypobrachial gland or “bloom” transecting its body. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>3. Squeeze the Liquid Out</h4>
			<br>
			<p>Take out the gland, a bulb full of liquid. Squeeze it, and then a single drop of clear liquid, smelling of garlic, will be released. Within moments, the sunlight will turn the liquid first pale yellow, then sea green, then blue, and finally a dark purple-red. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>4.Dissolve the Liquid in Water</h4>
			<br>
			<p>
				Take all the semi-liquid parts taken from two kinds of shellfishes, and put them into a cup of water. Use a stick to stir it until it is fully mixed and turns into a yellow liquid.
			</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>5.Left It in the Sun</h4>
			<br>
			<p>
				Left the liquid in the sun for a couple of minutes. Then you can put some cloth into the liquid to get it dyed. It will take a few minutes for the cloth to turn into a tyrian purple.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>6. Get Tyrian Purple</h4>
			<br>
			<p> Experiment with different portions of the liquid from two shellfishes or different duration under the sun, you will get different shades of purple and blue.</p>
