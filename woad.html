			<h4>
			1.Harvesting the woad leaves.</h4>
			<p>
			<br>July and August are the best months for harvesting woad in the UK. Cut leaves from first year woad plants with secateurs, near to their base, and fill a supermarket carrier bag full (about 1250 grams).Wash them well under the tap. Wash again by dipping and shaking a handful at a time in a bucket full of water. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>
			2.Dye Extraction - Steeping the leaves</h4>
			<p>
			<br>Fill a 10 litre stainless steel saucepan two-thirds full with water. It is best to use soft water, e.g. rain water. Heat the water up to 90°C but do not let it boil inside the saucepan. Put the leaves in the saucepan and let them steep for just 10 minutes in water at 80°C.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>
			3.Cooling the liquid</h4>
			<p>
			<br>Remove the saucepan from the heat and put it in a bowl full of cold or icy water. Get the liquid down to 55 degrees C in 5 minutes. Stir the saucepan and change the water from the bowl. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>
			4.Straining the liquid</h4>
			<p>
			<br>When the liquid has reached 55 degrees C, put a colander over a bucket and then strain the liquid through the colander.Put on rubber gloves to press the leaves and extract all the liquid. Pour the liquid back into the saucepan leaving the debris behind in the bucket. The spent leaves can then go on the compost.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>
			5.Adding soda ash</h4>
			<p>
			<br>Fill a mug-size container with boiling water and add 3 teaspoons of soda ash (it produces less froth than washing soda), dissolve well and let it cool slightly.When the woad extract liquid in the saucepan has cooled to 50°C, add the soda ash. Do not put soda ash when woad solution is over 50°C, or you will destroy the blue. The vat will turn to a greeny-brown colour and the pH should be about 9.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>

			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>
			6.Aerating the vat</h4>
			<p>
			<br>The woad vat now needs to be aerated to precipitate the pigment. To aerate the vat, whisk with an electric whisk or a manual one. </p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>
			7.Concentrating the Pigment</h4>
			<p>
			<br>Let the pigment settle undisturbed for 2 to 3 hours. Using a soup ladle, very gently transfer a third of the liquid from the top of the pan into a bucket. Pour the remaining liquid into 4 or 5 large coffee jars with the help of a funnel. Put the jars in the shade and let the sediment settle for a couple of hours. Let the liquid in the jar settle for a couple of hours. Carefully empty 2/3 of the jar or siphon most of liquid away with a glass siphon. Then fill it again with clean water. Repeat two or three times more until there is clear water over blue sediment.</p>
